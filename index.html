        <p>
            Eggerue was raised in Southeast London in Peckham, a neighborhood that is mostly British Nigerian. Eggerue attended Goose Green Primary School. Eggerue then moved on to Notre Dame School for her secondary education. Her family is Igbo. She attended college to study fashion design but was unable to finish her degree due to depression.
            In 2017, Eggerue started #SaggyBoobsMatter, a hashtag that gained prominence on Twitter and Instagram, to challenge the convention that women with large breasts must wear a bra if their breasts sag. As a teenager she felt insecure because her breasts did not look like a model on the packaging of her first bra. She later decided to embrace her shape and posted a picture wearing a dress without a bra in September 2017, using the hashtag. According to Eggerue, "“There is enough room for everybody in the body positivity movement. But we must work together to make room for those more marginalised than us.” Eggerue has received backlash to the campaign. Early in 2018, one of her braless photos was turned into a meme that referred to her and another black woman as unattractive. She then started a blog called The Slumflower to highlight fashion that is not covered within the mainstream.The name refers to the concept of a rose growing from concrete, and comes from the short film created by creative duo Street Etiquette.The blog features modern street style fashions that are affordable. She also writes on topics like friendship, dating, racism, and sexism.
